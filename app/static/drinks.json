They must be famous because they do something completely different, because I followed this recipe exactly and it tasted nothing like the refreshing drink I had experienced.  These were very boring.

As a bartender I am hyper-critical and I see lots of people over do it on the ingredients. Personally, I use 6 mint leaves to muddle.  I think it's the minty flavor that makes this drink so unique and refreshing.  If you're getting a bitter flavor, you're mashing the rind of the lime too much.  You want to release the juices, but not the oil from the rind.  That's where the bitterness comes from. This recipe has the perfect amount of lime if you're juicing it right:)", "stars": "3"}, {"body": "Muddling is the key to a good Mojito.  You should put about 3 or 4 sprigs of mint and 3 lime wedges.  You really have to put some muscle behind it because you're trying to extract as many of the natural oils from the lime as possible.  I have never had good luck with sugar in these. A simple syrup (1 part sugar, 2 parts water) is the best way to go.  Your final drink should be composed of 1/3 rum, 1/3 simple syrup and 1/3 club soda.  Using a smaller glass is the key.", "stars": "2"}, {"body": "it works...i should have bruised the mint as recommended instread of slicing it..b/c then it floats through the ice to the top and makes it difficult to drink.. also good to substitute rum with sake", "stars": "5"}, {"body": "Do not use confectioners' sugar.

At no time should there be any butter floating as a glob that you have to \"mop\" up. You don't have your crock pot hot enough. Start it out on high if you plan on having this drink in a couple of hours. I let it usually simmer for 4-5 hrs and it is an after dinner drink. When the crock is steaming and the buter is glistening, then you have your batch correct. Don't add the rum to the pot if it is too much. Add it to the each mug to taste. If you alter this recipe with splenda or margarine and still rate this poorly, that is your problem. Best of luck to those who take another stab at it.

I keep it in the freezer all summer and use it when ever I want a nice cold punch like drink.  If you do not add the tea it will not taste the same, so don't forget the tea.

During the holidays I try and find cranberry ginger ale instead of lemon-lime soda or you could use a sour soda like 50-50 or squirt.

If you do decide to make this delicious concotion, try these tips:    1.  If you are in a rush, mix it in a glass bowl or cup and microwave for about 20 seconds to dissolve the sugar and bring the oil out of the zest.  If you have time to wait overnight, marinate in the fridge and shake occasionally.  Mason jars work great for this ;)    2.  Unless you like drinking greenery with your margarita, strain the zest out before mixing/serving.    3.  You can easily reduce the tequila by half and still feel good after drinking it :)    4.

It's VERY smooth. \nI have my own style of preparing this. I pack around 1 cup of fresh mint leaves in to a clean glass jar and bruise the leaves by smushing them up against the sides of the jar with a wooden spoon. After the sugar syrup is cooked I pour it in to the jar, smuch some more but not hard enough to create too many bits of leaf debris, close the lid, cool on the counter then chill in the fridge overnight (in a pinch I've given it an ice bath!). When chilled I drain the mixture through cheesecloth, remove the leaves and either pour it back in to the glass jar or in to a condiment style squeeze bottle. \nI get tremendous reviews making it this way and serving it with the Woodford and even non-bourbon drinkers enjoy it. \n\nLastly- TRY MAKING THIS WITH BASIL instead of mint! I saw a recipe for it in SL and my f=husband and friends practically BEG me for it all year long! I use fresh basil straight from the garden and otherwise make it the exact same way.  It's not as sweet and is incredibly refreshing! I've also recently had a Lemongrass julep (same deal, just use lemongrass instead of basil or mint) and a mint-ginger julep. The ginger gave a nice kick.", "stars": "5"}, {"body": "Decided to start on my Derby celebrations a little early this year, and found this recipe. Lovely!

So simple!  Also, sometimes I put in Cointreau or Grand Marnier in place of some of the tequila - maybe 1/4 cup - it's sweet so keep it minimal.  I always serve mine on the rocks.  Or you can use another carbonated bev, such as ginger ale or one of those Smirnoff drinks. If you won't drink the whole batch in one sitting, just don't put the beer in to the pitcher; add it to each glass - that way you can save the batch for weeks and drink it as you want.
