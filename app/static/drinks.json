Drinks are so reliant on personal taste so this review is more for information than anything: Use fresh juice or expect a different drink.

I only added a pinch of sugar (because it isn't quite as sweet as the fresh I get, but almost).  I know that my family would have wanted the sweetener but I don't think I'd need it with fresh juice.  I did end up adding more tequila and triple sec (maybe double), just preference.  I used fresh persian lime juice for one and \"keywest lime juice\" (Joe and Nellies) for the other and they aren't even close to the same drink. The bottled juice just made it so harsh.

If you are in a rush, mix it in a glass bowl or cup and microwave for about 20 seconds to dissolve the sugar and bring the oil out of the zest.  If you have time to wait overnight, marinate in the fridge and shake occasionally.  Mason jars work great for this ;)    2.

So simple!  Also, sometimes I put in Cointreau or Grand Marnier in place of some of the tequila - maybe 1/4 cup - it's sweet so keep it minimal.  I always serve mine on the rocks.  Or you can use another carbonated bev, such as ginger ale or one of those Smirnoff drinks. If you won't drink the whole batch in one sitting, just don't put the beer in to the pitcher; add it to each glass - that way you can save the batch for weeks and drink it as you want.  I think it's best if the mix is at room temperature so the ice melts some. One more thing - I recommend using a lighter color beer so you don't make it look funky.

I came across it at a bourbon tasting and fell in love, and since then have seen it umpteen times used in varying recipes in Southern Living mag. It's VERY smooth. \nI have my own style of preparing this. I pack around 1 cup of fresh mint leaves in to a clean glass jar and bruise the leaves by smushing them up against the sides of the jar with a wooden spoon. After the sugar syrup is cooked I pour it in to the jar, smuch some more but not hard enough to create too many bits of leaf debris, close the lid, cool on the counter then chill in the fridge overnight (in a pinch I've given it an ice bath!). When chilled I drain the mixture through cheesecloth, remove the leaves and either pour it back in to the glass jar or in to a condiment style squeeze bottle. \nI get tremendous reviews making it this way and serving it with the Woodford and even non-bourbon drinkers enjoy it. \n\nLastly- TRY MAKING THIS WITH BASIL instead of mint! I saw a recipe for it in SL and my f=husband and friends practically BEG me for it all year long! I use fresh basil straight from the garden and otherwise make it the exact same way.  It's not as sweet and is incredibly refreshing! I've also recently had a Lemongrass julep (same deal, just use lemongrass instead of basil or mint) and a mint-ginger julep.

Hints: *Do start with a pan that will fit in your freezer, lined with Parchment Paper* 1. Always use REAL butter (nothing is like REAL butter- nothing). 2. Don't let your cherries dry out like crazy dry before you wrap them. Make sure the outside is really dry so the 'dough' will wrap around it well, but the juice that's still inside the cherries lends to the 'liquification' process that happens in the next few days. 3. Don't use a huge amount of dough around each cherry. I found that using about 1/8 inch (and of course, I'm NOT measuring...just eyeball it & don't pack it on like a golfball :) this stuff is really rich -and delicious- but RICH...and yowehangoawjgo", "stars": "5"}, {"body": "Very indulgent!

Pour the Half and Half into the 6-8 quart stock pot and bring to a slow simmer. Meanwhile, take 1 cup of hot Half and Half out of the stock pot and while using the mixer on the high setting gradually combine the hot Half and Half into the mixing bowl with the egg mixture. This process will temper the eggs before you add them back into the stock pot.  After combining all of the mixing bowl contents into the stock pot, stir constantly on low for 40 to 45 minutes or until the mixture reaches 168-170 degrees on a candy thermometer. While the mixture cooks it will become thicker and will continue to temper and heat the eggs to safety. Add 2 teaspoons of pure Vanilla extract and nutmeg.

Now, Naples34102 (Mrs. Spunky Buddy): I actually liked these a lot more than I thought I would, but I have to say there is no way I could have drank the full amount of either, as both are rich and sweet, more of a cordial or after-dinner drink than a cocktail in my view.  I thought I would much prefer the \u201cHis\u201d version with the vodka and Frangelico, but found it decidedly sweeter than I thought it would be.  The \u201cHers\u201d version on the other hand, which I thought would be too girly for my tastes, was surprisingly delicious. We used whipped cream vodka as that\u2019s what we have here in Naples, and the combination of that with the raspberry vodka, cr\u00e8me de cacao, chocolate syrup and half and half made this like a drinkable dessert, but oddly without being too sweet.

We've always got alcohol lying around never getting used, so I thought I'd try this today.  I don't like ice in drinks, but I wanted this to be cold so I decided I'd just go for it.  I don't have a way of crushing ice, though, other than going at it with a meat mallet, so I decided to pass and just use ice cubes.  I'm not feeling that energetic or destructive today.  I'm not sure if it's the oj or what, but something tastes almost (but not quite!) bitter in this.  So, I like it but maybe a bit less oj and a bit more pineapple  . . . not sure.
