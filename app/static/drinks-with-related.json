If you do decide to make this delicious concotion, try these tips:    1.  If you are in a rush, mix it in a glass bowl or cup and microwave for about 20 seconds to dissolve the sugar and bring the oil out of the zest.  If you have time to wait overnight, marinate in the fridge and shake occasionally.  Mason jars work great for this ;)    2.  Unless you like drinking greenery with your margarita, strain the zest out before mixing/serving.    3.  You can easily reduce the tequila by half and still feel good after drinking it :)    4.

The cream will separate a bit and make it less visually appealing after it's been sitting for awhile.  Best to make them as you're drinking them even if you're serving more than one. Also, you can double the orange juice for more of a cocktail and less of a martini if you want to go a little lighter on the alcohol.

The kissing part was a lot of fun, but I fail to see how it enhanced the flavor experience. I found that in small amounts these were tasty cordials.  Now, Naples34102 (Mrs. Spunky Buddy): I actually liked these a lot more than I thought I would, but I have to say there is no way I could have drank the full amount of either, as both are rich and sweet, more of a cordial or after-dinner drink than a cocktail in my view.  I thought I would much prefer the \u201cHis\u201d version with the vodka and Frangelico, but found it decidedly sweeter than I thought it would be.  The \u201cHers\u201d version on the other hand, which I thought would be too girly for my tastes, was surprisingly delicious. We used whipped cream vodka as that\u2019s what we have here in Naples, and the combination of that with the raspberry vodka, cr\u00e8me de cacao, chocolate syrup and half and half made this like a drinkable dessert, but oddly without being too sweet.

So simple!  Also, sometimes I put in Cointreau or Grand Marnier in place of some of the tequila - maybe 1/4 cup - it's sweet so keep it minimal.  I always serve mine on the rocks.  Or you can use another carbonated bev, such as ginger ale or one of those Smirnoff drinks. If you won't drink the whole batch in one sitting, just don't put the beer in to the pitcher; add it to each glass - that way you can save the batch for weeks and drink it as you want.

I came across it at a bourbon tasting and fell in love, and since then have seen it umpteen times used in varying recipes in Southern Living mag. It's VERY smooth. \nI have my own style of preparing this. I pack around 1 cup of fresh mint leaves in to a clean glass jar and bruise the leaves by smushing them up against the sides of the jar with a wooden spoon. After the sugar syrup is cooked I pour it in to the jar, smuch some more but not hard enough to create too many bits of leaf debris, close the lid, cool on the counter then chill in the fridge overnight (in a pinch I've given it an ice bath!). When chilled I drain the mixture through cheesecloth, remove the leaves and either pour it back in to the glass jar or in to a condiment style squeeze bottle. \nI get tremendous reviews making it this way and serving it with the Woodford and even non-bourbon drinkers enjoy it. \n\nLastly- TRY MAKING THIS WITH BASIL instead of mint! I saw a recipe for it in SL and my f=husband and friends practically BEG me for it all year long! I use fresh basil straight from the garden and otherwise make it the exact same way.  It's not as sweet and is incredibly refreshing! I've also recently had a Lemongrass julep (same deal, just use lemongrass instead of basil or mint) and a mint-ginger julep.

Hints: *Do start with a pan that will fit in your freezer, lined with Parchment Paper* 1. Always use REAL butter (nothing is like REAL butter- nothing). 2. Don't let your cherries dry out like crazy dry before you wrap them. Make sure the outside is really dry so the 'dough' will wrap around it well, but the juice that's still inside the cherries lends to the 'liquification' process that happens in the next few days. 3. Don't use a huge amount of dough around each cherry.

Pour the Half and Half into the 6-8 quart stock pot and bring to a slow simmer. Meanwhile, take 1 cup of hot Half and Half out of the stock pot and while using the mixer on the high setting gradually combine the hot Half and Half into the mixing bowl with the egg mixture. This process will temper the eggs before you add them back into the stock pot.  After combining all of the mixing bowl contents into the stock pot, stir constantly on low for 40 to 45 minutes or until the mixture reaches 168-170 degrees on a candy thermometer. While the mixture cooks it will become thicker and will continue to temper and heat the eggs to safety. Add 2 teaspoons of pure Vanilla extract and nutmeg.

I did use a mixture of lemons and limes in the sour mix though, and it was slightly more than the 1/ 1/2 cups. I poured all of that into the pitcher. It's weird the recipe tells you to make all that sour mix and not use it all... But the end result were very good margaritas that are not too sweet. I used only 1 1/2 cups tequila instead of 2 cups, and although I would have preferred them full strength, all my guests still thought they were pretty strong and were glad I didn't use anymore tequila than that.
